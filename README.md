This program will create a system to keep track of college students as they pay tuition and take courses. Each student should have of the following attributes: •             Name •             Student ID number •      Courses taken •      Units accumulated•               Total tuition paid Courses will have their own attributes, which need to be kept track of as well: •             Name •             Course ID •             Unit amount •             Tuition Cost The program should be driven by a menu that allows the user to perform the following actions: •             Create a new student •             Create a new course •             View a list of courses (make 5 courses) •             Add a course taken to an existing student (and update tuition) •             View all of a student’s properties •             Closes out the program Your program MUST contain: •             At least one class •             At least one array •             At least one loop •             At least one function (besides your main() function) •             Input validation for numerical user entries I am looking for these main elements in your    program as a basis of grading it: •             Your program demonstrates each menu item twice (except closing the program) •             Your programming style is easily readable, including indentation and naming conventions •             How you split up your program through classes, arrays, functions and loops •             Your program and output are professional, including proper spelling and formatting •             Include a commented header stating your name and that this is your final (IF YOU DON’T INCLUDE THIS, I WON’T KNOW WHO TO GIVE CREDIT TO)
